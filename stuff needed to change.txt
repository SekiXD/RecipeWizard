In this, I have included a demo of how the async tasks should be used and also noted how each async task should be used. The only things I changed to Recipe was I added a constructor to make a Recipe without instructions, since they have separate calls for getting the instructions and other info of a recipe. I also added concerns of some stuff for the recipe and ingredients.

Things to consider including for Recipe: 
Ingredients used per step
Servings
Amount of ingredients
maybe tags to indicate its vegetarian gluten free etc
author of recipe
time needed to cook
do you want original string, which is more descriptive such as "2 medium shallots" or just amount + "shallots"
more nutrients?

where are you going to use the images of ingredients?
Some of the ingredients, such as preprocessed foods, dont have images necessarily. 
does ingredient need to be checked?
